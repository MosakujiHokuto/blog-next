It's been a long time since the last time I've written anything on this blog. Of course there can be a lot of excluses, like I had a pretty shitty year in 2022 (actually ever year since COVID has been shitty), but that doesn't change the fact that this blog needs some attention.

Well, let's give it some.

So I took my time in this holiday and gave it a complete overhaul. The blog system is now completely rewritten with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), which allows me to code in Typescript & React. This enabled me to implement many new fancy features I can't or won't borther to implement with Hugo, like the ability to blog in multiple languages, as you can see with this post. It's probably the time to practice some more English so this can be Handly. Also I'm planning on implementing the ability to switch themes.

Also you can see this time I attempted a pretty different style on the site. It's mean to be an Retro Sci-Fi style theme inspired by TNO and VA-11, tho at the time of writing this theme obviously needs a lot more polishing. Also I'm planning on creating an amber colored version. I'm not an expert on art and UI design so the outcome might not be so good as to use a ready-made template, but it's my own blog anyway so what's the point to not attempt and fail?

The blog is hosted with Cloudflare Pages, and I'll probably write a note about it later. And in case you are curious, [code](https://github.com/MosakujiHokuto/blog-next) is hosted on github. Feel free to fork and use it for your own site (but there's plenty of good implementations so why this one?)
